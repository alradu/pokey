This test is similar to the custom headers test in the GET examples, but it uses POST instead of GET.  The difference being that we provide a payload file, which will be sent as the message body of the request.  These can be of any file type.  Like the custom_headers example, yahoo actually doesn't do anything with the payload.  As of this writing, Yahoo lets you post arbitrarily but google does not.  This is just an example.
