This test is similar to the basic google.com ping, except it sends custom headers with the request. Headers are useful for a number of things, including basic authentication, spoofing user agents, caching, and interoperating with servers that communicate over high level protocols such as AS/2.  With this particular test, google does nothing with the additional information we provide.  It's just an example.
